            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <p>This study investigated the morphological effects of steam sterilization on different 3D printable materials intended for surgical use in veterinary medicine. The research focused on creating patient-specific sawing templates for performing corrective osteotomies.</p>

            <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
            <p>Test specimens were 3D-printed using the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) method with five different materials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Polylactic acid (PLA)</li>
                <li>Polyamide (PA, nylon)</li>
                <li>Polycarbonates (PC)</li>
                <li>Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)</li>
                <li>GreenTEC Pro®</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each material was printed in two filling grades: 30% and 100% infill. Specimens were steam sterilized using a standard program:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 121°C</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> 2-3 bar</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            
            <h4>Materials That Failed</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box warning">
                <p><strong>PC, PA, and ABS:</strong> Showed great morphological deviations from the template after 3D-printing and steam sterilization (>1%)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ABS:</strong> Proved completely unsuitable for steam sterilization - specimens warped severely and could no longer be measured</li>
                    <li><strong>PA (Polyamide):</strong> Changed state of aggregation after autoclaving, surface became slightly greasy, unsuitable for prompt intraoperative use</li>
                    <li><strong>PC (Polycarbonate):</strong> Moderate to severe surface deformations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Materials That Succeeded</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p><strong>PLA:</strong> Demonstrated fewer morphological deviations but still showed some changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>30% infill: Length reduced by -3.19%, width by -3.15% after autoclaving</li>
                    <li>100% infill: Length reduced by -0.52%, width by -0.42% after autoclaving</li>
                    <li>Better performance with higher infill percentage</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>GreenTEC Pro® (100% infill):</strong> Best performer overall</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smallest deviations found with solid body construction</li>
                    <li>After autoclaving, specimens showed deviation below the 1% limit</li>
                    <li>Length deviation: -0.1%, Width: -0.1%, Depth: -0.1%</li>
                    <li>Maintained dimensional stability suitable for clinical use</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Material Properties of GreenTEC Pro®</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>High-performance biopolymer made from renewable raw materials</li>
                <li>Completely biodegradable and compostable</li>
                <li>Medium-hard but slightly flexible</li>
                <li>Excellent mechanical and thermal loading properties</li>
                <li>Food safe and odorless</li>
                <li>Inexpensive and economically viable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>The study concluded that GreenTEC Pro® with 100% filling is the most suitable material for precise 3D modeling and clinical use due to its steam sterilization resistance. The material fulfills requirements of autoclavability, biocompatibility, and economic aspects for clinical use. However, further microbiological and biomechanical investigations were recommended.</p>

            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <p>This study compared the efficacy and reliability of autoclave and ethylene oxide (EO) methods for sterilization of objects printed in PLA, enabling their safe use in surgeries. The research specifically addressed the challenge that PLA is thermosensitive with melting beginning at 120°C.</p>

            <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
            <p>Forty cubic-shaped objects were printed with PLA material:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>20 solid objects (100% infill)</li>
                <li>20 hollow objects (printed with little internal filling)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Group 1 (Autoclave):</strong> 10 solid + 10 hollow objects sterilized using "fast cycle" at 121°C</p>
            <p><strong>Group 2 (Ethylene Oxide):</strong> 10 solid + 10 hollow objects sterilized using EO "cold" method</p>

            <p>After sterilization, objects were stored for one week, then cultured in Brian Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. Hollow objects were broken during sowing to communicate the internal "dead space" with the culture medium. Cultures were incubated for 48 hours at 34-37°C, then sowed in Blood Agar-MacConkey and MacConkey Agar.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>

            <h4>Autoclave Results (Group 1)</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box warning">
                <p><strong>Solid Objects:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50% showed bacterial growth</li>
                    <li>50% were negative (sterile)</li>
                    <li><strong>NOT 100% effective - NOT SAFE</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Hollow Objects:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>30% showed bacterial growth</li>
                    <li>70% were negative</li>
                    <li>Better than solid, but still not fully effective</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Ethylene Oxide Results (Group 2)</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p><strong>Solid Objects:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0% bacterial growth</li>
                    <li>100% negative (completely sterile)</li>
                    <li><strong>COMPLETE STERILIZATION ACHIEVED</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Hollow Objects:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>20% showed bacterial growth</li>
                    <li>80% were negative</li>
                    <li>Better than autoclave but not fully effective</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Bacteria Isolated</h4>
            <p>In all cases of contamination, the bacteria isolated was non-coagulase-producing <em>Staphylococcus</em> (Gram positive).</p>

            <h3>Discussion Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PLA is the most used synthetic material due to being biocompatible, non-polluting, biodegradable, low-cost, and easy to handle</li>
                <li>Main disadvantage: thermosensitive with melting beginning at 120°C</li>
                <li>Autoclave "fast cycle" at 121°C was tested as an alternative but proved insufficient</li>
                <li>EO is viable for "cold" sterilization of thermosensitive materials</li>
                <li>Other methods (plasma gas, gamma rays) are effective but costly</li>
                <li>Printing with partial internal filling is common in household printing but creates "dead spaces" that cannot be properly sterilized</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical Recommendations</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box important">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>For PLA objects:</strong> Use 100% infill (solid) printing - MANDATORY</li>
                    <li><strong>Sterilization method:</strong> Ethylene oxide is superior to autoclave for PLA</li>
                    <li><strong>Hollow objects:</strong> Neither method was fully effective - AVOID for critical applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Autoclave limitations:</strong> Even "fast cycle" at 121°C is NOT RECOMMENDED for PLA sterilization</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Sterilization by both autoclave and EO was not effective for hollow printed objects. Solid objects sterilized by autoclave did not demonstrate 100% of negative samples and were not safe in this assay. Complete absence of contamination occurred only with solid objects sterilized by EO, which is the combination recommended by the authors.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>

            <h4>Surface Characteristics and Bacterial Size</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box info">
                <p><strong>3D Print Imperfections:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smallest dimple size: 0.5 microns (only 1-2% of all imperfections)</li>
                    <li>Average imperfection size: 1 micron</li>
                    <li>98-99% of flaws are larger than 0.5 microns</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Bacterial Dimensions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average bacteria length: 2-5 microns</li>
                    <li>Average bacteria diameter: 0.5-1.5 microns</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Layer lines and surface imperfections are NOT the primary contamination concern. Bacteria are generally larger than the imperfections and need room to grow.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Lead Contamination Assessment</h4>
            <p>The study addressed concerns about lead contamination from brass nozzles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard 0.4mm brass nozzle contains 1.5% lead (0.045g total)</li>
                <li>21% of nozzle material is removed during manufacturing (0.63g)</li>
                <li>This removes 21% of the lead, leaving 0.035g</li>
                <li>Filament only contacts 21% of remaining lead (0.007g)</li>
                <li>Lead leaches in very small amounts, primarily from handling or water contact</li>
                <li>Mass comparison of new vs. used nozzles (1000 hours) showed no measurable loss</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Lead contamination from brass nozzles is negligible and not a significant concern</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> Studies show consumers using standard brass keys are exposed to 19 times the safe amount of lead - far more than from 3D printing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <p>This groundbreaking study investigated the morphological effects of hydrogen peroxide low-temperature sterilization on surgical objects 3D-printed in PLA and PETG. The authors note this is the first study regarding morphologic deformation of 3D-printed objects in PLA and PETG after sterilization for medical use.</p>

            <h3>Background and Rationale</h3>
            <p>The study addressed a critical challenge in 3D printing for medical applications: sterilization of thermoplastic materials. The researchers noted that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3D printing is experiencing rapid development in surgery, especially cranio-maxillofacial surgery</li>
                <li>Applications include anatomical models, surgical guides, and custom implants</li>
                <li>Sterilization is mandatory for operating room use</li>
                <li>PLA and PETG are sensitive to conventional thermal steam sterilization (121°C+)</li>
                <li>Very few articles fully describe disinfection/sterilization techniques for 3D printed objects</li>

            <h4>Reference Object</h4>
            <p>The study used a cutting guide for genioplasty (chin surgery) as the reference object. Genioplasty is a widely used surgical technique to correct chin deformity through osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible.</p>

            <h4>3D Printing Process</h4>
            <p>Two series of 21 identical guides were printed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Series 1:</strong> PLA (Makerbot® PLA filament 1.75mm)</li>
                <li><strong>Series 2:</strong> PETG (Taulman® 3D guidel!ne® filament 1.75mm)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Printer:</strong> Replicator+® (Makerbot Industries®) using Fused Deposition Modeling</p>

            <h4>Sterilization Process</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> STERRAD® 100S (Johnson & Johnson®)</li>

                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Always lower than 55°C</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Comparison Process</h4>
            <p>Morphology was compared at three time points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>T0:</strong> Computer-designed guide in 3D before printing (STL file)</li>
                <li><strong>T1:</strong> Guide after 3D printing, before sterilization</li>
                <li><strong>T2:</strong> Guide after 3D printing and after sterilization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>CT scanning was performed at T1 and T2 using high-resolution protocol:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>System: SOMATOM Emotion 16</li>
                <li>Tube current: 130 mAs</li>

            <h3>Clinical Significance</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p>Although differences were statistically significant, they had <strong>NO impact on clinical use</strong> because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All morphological differences were <strong>less than 0.2mm</strong></li>
                    <li>Differences could be related to:
                        <ul>

            <h3>Material Properties Discussion</h3>

            <h4>PLA Considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>PLA is a polymer composed of L-lactide and D-lactide chains</li>
                <li>Thermal and mechanical properties depend on ratio and distribution of L-LA and D-LA</li>
                <li>Melting temperatures and glass transition temperature vary by brand</li>
                <li>Hydrogen peroxide sterilization (<55°C) can be applied to all PLA subtypes</li>
                <li>Note: One study (Boursier et al.) found PLA could be autoclaved, but this study found inconsistent results - likely due to different PLA brands and printer types</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>PETG Advantages</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p><strong>PETG (Taulman® 3D guidel!ne®) is preferred for medical use because:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proven biocompatibility in accordance with industrial standards</li>
                    <li>European ISO10993 certification</li>
                    <li>American FDA-approval</li>
                    <li>No prior studies on PETG sterilization found in literature - this is the first</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box important">
                <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Steam sterilization is NOT suitable for PLA and PETG (causes melting/deformation)</li>
                    <li>Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization is the BEST alternative</li>
                    <li>Morphological deformations are sub-millimeter (<0.2mm) and clinically acceptable</li>
                    <li>This technique can be extrapolated to any 3D printed medical object</li>
                    <li>Successfully tested on other objects (e.g., anatomical mandible models) with no deformation</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
                <p>Hydrogen peroxide low-temperature sterilization is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> for sterilization of 3D printed objects in PLA and PETG for medical and surgical use.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Study Significance</h3>
            <p>The authors emphasize that to their knowledge, this is the <strong>first study about morphologic deformation of 3D-printed objects in PLA and PETG for medical use after sterilization</strong>. This groundbreaking research provides essential guidance for hospitals and medical facilities implementing in-house 3D printing programs.</p>

            <h2>7. Important Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Infill Percentage: The Critical Factor</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box important">
                <h4>100% Infill is MANDATORY</h4>
                <p>This is the single most critical factor for food safety and sterilization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hollow objects or partial infill create "dead spaces"</strong></li>
                    <li>Dead spaces harbor bacteria and biofilms that cannot be reached by cleaning agents</li>
                    <li>Neither autoclave nor ethylene oxide effectively sterilizes hollow objects</li>
                    <li>Even hydrogen peroxide gas plasma shows reduced effectiveness in hollow objects</li>
                    <li>Research shows 20-30% contamination rates persist in hollow objects even after sterilization</li>
                    <li><strong>NO EXCEPTIONS:</strong> Always use 100% infill for food or medical applications</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Biofilm Formation and Removal</h3>
            <h4>What are Biofilms?</h4>
            <p>Biofilms are protective layers that bacteria create when stressed. They act as a shield that makes bacteria resistant to standard cleaning methods.</p>

            <h4>How Biofilms Form</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bacteria sense environmental stress (heat, chemicals, drying)</li>
                <li>They secrete protective polysaccharide matrix</li>
                <li>This creates a "blanket" that shields bacteria from cleaning agents</li>
                <li>Biofilms can harbor multiple bacterial species</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Breaking Down Biofilms</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p><strong>Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chemically disrupts biofilm structure</li>
                    <li>Inhibits bacterial growth and biofilm formation</li>
                    <li>Physical abrasive action helps remove biofilms</li>
                    <li>Safe and non-toxic</li>
                    <li>Research-proven effective against cystic fibrosis pathogens</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Bleach Water (Sodium Hypochlorite):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dissolves biofilms chemically</li>
                    <li>Kills bacteria within biofilms</li>
                    <li>200ppm concentration is FDA-required for food establishments</li>
                    <li>Must be used at room temperature (heat deactivates bleach)</li>
                    <li>2-minute soak recommended for best results</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Warning About Isopropyl Alcohol</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box warning">
                <p>Research has shown that ethanol and isopropyl alcohol can <strong>INCREASE biofilm formation</strong> in <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol exposure triggers biofilm production as a stress response</li>
                    <li>Higher alcohol concentrations lead to more biofilm formation</li>
                    <li>IPA should only be used AFTER proper cleaning with soap and water</li>
                    <li>Use as a final precautionary step, not as primary cleaning method</li>
                    <li>Always requires physical agitation (rubbing) to be effective</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Color Additives and Pigments</h3>
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pigments are added during filament manufacturing (melting stage)</li>
                <li>Companies often don't disclose pigment composition (trade secret)</li>
                <li>Pigments may not be food-safe unless specifically certified</li>
                <li>Colored pigments can leach into liquids over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <p><strong>FDA-Approved Coating Method:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coat 3D-printed items with food-safe resin</li>
                    <li>Approved under FDA Title 21, Volume 3</li>
                    <li>Same regulations as resinous counters and tables</li>
                    <li>Allow resin to fully cure before use</li>
                    <li>Creates barrier between colored plastic and food/liquids</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use natural/white filament when possible for food contact</li>
                    <li>If using colored filament, always coat with food-safe resin</li>
                    <li>Verify filament manufacturer certifications</li>
                    <li>Check MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for pigment information</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Nozzle Material Considerations</h3>
            <h4>Brass Nozzles and Lead Content</h4>
            <p>Research has thoroughly investigated lead contamination concerns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard 0.4mm brass nozzle contains 1.5% lead (0.045g total)</li>
                <li>Manufacturing process removes 21% of nozzle material (including lead)</li>
                <li>Only 0.007g of lead potentially contacts filament</li>
                <li>Lead transfer through friction is negligible</li>
                <li>Mass measurements show no detectable loss after 1000 hours of printing</li>
                <li>Comparison: Brass keys expose users to 19× more lead than 3D printing</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Alternative Nozzle Materials</h4>
            <div class="highlight-box info">
                <p>For absolute safety and peace of mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stainless Steel Nozzles:</strong> Eliminate lead concerns entirely</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardened Steel:</strong> Durable and lead-free</li>

            <div class="highlight-box info">
                <p><strong>Common Misconception:</strong> Layer lines and surface imperfections are the biggest threat to food safety.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Scientific Reality:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average 3D print imperfection: 1 micron</li>
                    <li>Smallest dimples: 0.5 microns (only 1-2% of imperfections)</li>
                    <li>Average bacteria size: 2-5 microns length, 0.5-1.5 microns diameter</li>
                    <li>Bacteria need room to grow and reproduce</li>
                    <li>Soapy water can penetrate 0.1 micron spaces</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Layer lines are NOT the primary concern. Proper cleaning protocols are effective because cleaning solutions can reach spaces smaller than bacteria. The real concerns are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internal voids (hollow printing)</li>
                    <li>Biofilm formation</li>
                    <li>Inadequate cleaning protocols</li>
                    <li>Lack of verification testing</li>

            <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>

            <div class="highlight-box success">
                <h3>Key Takeaway: Yes, 3D Printed Objects CAN Be Made Food Safe and Sterile</h3>
                <p>Based on comprehensive published research from multiple institutions, 3D printed objects can be made food safe and even sterile for medical use with proper:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Material selection</li>
                    <li>Printing parameters</li>
                    <li>Cleaning protocols</li>
                    <li>Sterilization methods</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Critical Success Factors</h3>

            <h4>1. Material Selection is Paramount</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Food Contact:</strong> PETG (FDA-approved) is the gold standard</li>
                <li><strong>For Medical Use:</strong> PETG or GreenTEC Pro® with appropriate sterilization</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> ABS for any food or medical application</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. 100% Infill is Non-Negotiable</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the single most important factor</li>
                <li>Hollow objects cannot be reliably sanitized or sterilized</li>
                <li>No exceptions for food or medical applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Proper Cleaning Protocols Work</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Layer lines are NOT the primary concern</li>
                <li>Warm soapy water + baking soda + bleach water achieves 90%+ reduction</li>
                <li>Properly cleaned 3D prints perform comparably to standard kitchen equipment</li>
                <li>Verification testing is essential</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Sterilization Technology Exists</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma is the gold standard for PLA/PETG</li>
                <li>GreenTEC Pro® uniquely withstands autoclave sterilization</li>
                <li>Sub-millimeter deformations are clinically acceptable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Debunked Myths</h3>

            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h4>Myth: Layer lines make 3D prints unsafe</h4>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Layer lines (1 micron average) are smaller than bacteria (2-5 microns). Cleaning solutions can penetrate 0.1 micron spaces. Layer lines are not the primary concern.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h4>Myth: Lead from brass nozzles contaminates prints</h4>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Lead transfer is negligible (0.007g potential contact). No measurable loss after 1000 hours of printing. Brass keys expose users to 19× more lead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h4>Myth: 3D printed objects can't be sterilized</h4>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma achieves effective sterilization with <0.2mm deformation. GreenTEC Pro® can even withstand autoclave sterilization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-fact">
                <h4>Myth: All 3D printed materials are the same</h4>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Material selection is critical. PETG is FDA-approved, ABS is not food-safe, and GreenTEC Pro® has unique autoclave resistance.</p>
            </div>
